# Exercise 8: Performance testing of web app (Optional)

Azure Load Testing Preview is a fully managed load-testing service that enables you to generate high-scale load. Regardless of where your applications are hosted, the service simulates traffic for them. It can be used by programmers, testers, and quality assurance (QA) engineers to enhance the speed, scalability, or capacity of applications.

Azure Load Testing is currently in preview because of which we have limited options available to it at the moment.

In this task, we will see how to load test the parts unlimited web application with Azure Load Testing Preview from the Azure portal.

1. Firstly, you will create an Azure Load Testing resource. In the Azure portal, click on **Show portal menu (1)** and select **+Create a resource (2)**.

10. Once the load test begins, you will be directed to the test run dashboard. Azure Load Testing records both client-side and server-side metrics while the load test is underway. 

11. In the dashboard, you will see the client-side metrics in real-time while the test is running. The data refreshes every five seconds by default.
